# üìä Statistics Fundamentals in Python
üîç Track Description
This learning track teaches you the fundamentals of statistics and probability using Python. You will learn to analyze data, build statistical models, and draw meaningful conclusions through hypothesis testing.

# üóÇÔ∏è Course Outline
1. Summary Statistics
Learn to compute and interpret basic summary statistics such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation. These values provide a foundational understanding of the data.

2. Random Numbers and Probability
Explore how to generate random numbers in Python and calculate probabilities. Understand the concepts of randomness, probability distributions, and simulations.

3. Distributions and the Central Limit Theorem
Dive into common probability distributions such as the normal and binomial distributions. Understand the Central Limit Theorem and its importance in inferential statistics.

4. Correlation and Experimental Design
Measure the strength and direction of relationships between variables using correlation. Learn how to properly design experiments to collect reliable data.

5. Simple Linear Regression Modeling
Build a simple linear regression model to identify and interpret the relationship between two variables. Use the model to make predictions based on data.

6. Predictions and Model Objects
Use your regression models to make predictions and explore the internal components of model objects in Python.

7. Assessing Model Fit
Evaluate how well your regression model fits the data using R-squared, residual analysis, and diagnostic plots.

8. Simple Logistic Regression Modeling
Learn to build logistic regression models to predict binary outcomes (e.g., yes/no, true/false) and interpret the results.

9. Parallel Slopes and Interactions
Understand how to include categorical variables and interaction terms in regression models to capture more complex relationships.

10. Multiple Linear and Logistic Regression
Expand on simple regression models by adding multiple explanatory variables. Improve prediction accuracy and model interpretation.

11. Introduction to Sampling
Learn the basics of sampling and how to collect data from a population using sound statistical principles.

12. Sampling Methods
Explore different sampling techniques such as simple random sampling, stratified sampling, and cluster sampling.

13. Sampling Distributions and Bootstrap
Understand how sample statistics vary and how to use the bootstrap method to estimate uncertainty and confidence intervals.

14. Hypothesis Testing Fundamentals
Learn the core ideas of hypothesis testing including null and alternative hypotheses, p-values, and significance levels.

15. Two-Sample, ANOVA, and Proportion Tests
Use statistical tests to compare means between groups and to test differences in proportions across populations.

16. Non-Parametric Tests
Apply non-parametric tests that do not assume a specific distribution, ideal for small samples or skewed data.

# üéØ Final Project
Apply what you've learned in a real-world scenario. Perform a hypothesis test to determine whether more goals are scored in women‚Äôs soccer matches than in men‚Äôs matches.
